<h1>Chemyo YK11 Review: My Personal Experience and Results</h1>

<p>I’ve spent 8 weeks running Chemyo’s YK11 SARM in a straight 10 mg daily cycle. I saw lean muscle gains, better strength, and almost no side effects. Here’s my honest take.</p>

<h2>What Is YK11?</h2>
<p>YK11 is a myostatin inhibitor. It boosts follistatin and protein synthesis in muscle cells. That leads to faster gains. It also supports bone density. It’s a potent SARM that many use for bulking or cutting.</p>

<h2>Why I Chose Chemyo’s YK11</h2>
<p>I looked for purity, lab testing, and fast shipping. Chemyo had third‑party results showing ≥ 98 % purity. Their site also offers clear dosing guides and a 60‑day guarantee. I placed my order via this link: <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/yk11/sarm/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank">Chemyo YK11 SARM</a>.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product (SwissChems‑Style)</h2>
<p>I used a four‑point system inspired by SwissChems’ review methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purity &amp; Testing:</strong> I checked lab reports. Chemyo’s batch report matched label claims (98 %+ YK11).</li>
  <li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> I tracked lifts and bodyweight. I added 6 lbs of lean muscle in 8 weeks.</li>
  <li><strong>Value:</strong> At $0.80 per 10 mg capsule, it was cheaper than most brands I’ve tried.</li>
  <li><strong>Shipping &amp; Service:</strong> It arrived in 4 days to my Vilnius address. No customs hold.</li>
</ul>
<p>I gave Chemyo’s YK11 an overall score of 4.7/5. You can read more and order here: <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/yk11/sarm/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank">Get Chemyo YK11</a>.</p>

<h2>My Personal Results</h2>
<p>Week 1–2: I felt a slight pump during workouts. No fatigue.</p>
<p>Week 3–5: Strength rose on squats (+15 lbs) and bench (+10 lbs). I noticed harder muscle feel.</p>
<p>Week 6–8: Lean mass up by 6 lbs. Body fat stayed the same. No water bloat.</p>
<p>I monitored blood markers. All stayed in range. I ran a gentle PCT for 4 weeks after cycle end.</p>

<h2>Who Should Use YK11?</h2>

  <li><strong>Bulking:</strong> Build lean mass fast without excess water.</li>
  <li><strong>Cutting:</strong> Hold muscle while burning fat.</li>
